# Tricium Analyzer Contribution

## Types of Tricium functions

A **Tricium function** is takes some input and produces some output; there are
two types of functions: analyzers and isolators. The input and output types are
defined in [data.proto](../api/v1/data.proto).

A **Tricium analyzer** takes some input and produces Tricium `RESULTS`, which is
basically a list of comments that can be posted to Gerrit. Various different
analyzers may potentially use different input data types, so there are other
functions which can take some input and produce an intermediate data type.

Functions that don't produce results, but instead produce intermediate data are
called **isolators**. For example, GitFileIsolator takes `GIT_FILE_DETAILS` and
produces `FILES`, Most of the time, most people will want to develop analyzers
that use some existing data type, but the process for developing an isolator is
the same.

## Simple CIPD-based Function

Instructions below are based on the [Tricium Hello
analyzer](../functions/hello/) which is a tiny analyzer taking `FILES` and
producing `RESULTS` with a comment saying "Hello". This example demonstrates an
Analyzer that doesn't have any dependencies.

Other function examples may be found in [tricium/functions/](../functions/).

### Implement an Analyzer

Create a binary that consumes needed Tricium data, by reading from a
`tricium/data/<input-type>.json` file, and produces Tricium data, by writing to
a `tricium/data/<output-type>.json` file. You can find details about Tricium
data types, and their file paths, in [data.proto](../api/v1/data.proto).

### Local testing

Besides writing unit tests, you can also test run your analyzer locally,
because the analyzer is just a program that reads from local files and writes
to local files. You can make an example test input directory, for example
[tricium/functions/spacey/test/](../functions/spacey/test/).

Then, you can build your program (if necessary) and run it. For Go programs,
this may be done by running `go build` and then invoking the resulting binary
with the arguments `-input` and `-output`.

### Set up CIPD Package

Make sure you have the CIPD client installed; see
[installation instructions](https://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/install-depot-tools).
Add a cipd.yaml file to the root of your analyzer's directory tree, e.g.
[hello/cipd.yaml](../functions/hello/cipd.yaml):

```
package: infra/tricium/function/hello
install_mode: symlink
data:
        - file: hello
```

Note that package should be `infra/tricium/functions/ANALYZER`, replacing
CamelCase (e.g. ClangTidy) with words separated with dashes, e.g. (clang-tidy).
The data section should list files to be included in the CIPD package; see
[cipd/client/cipd/local/pkgdef.go](https://github.com/luci/luci-go/blob/master/cipd/client/cipd/local/pkgdef.go#L35)
for details.

### Deploy CIPD Package

Run the CIPD command line tool to create and tag the new release. If the CIPD
client complains about a lack of authentication, contact tricium-dev@google.com
to get added to the "tricium-contributors" group.

```
$ cipd create -pkg-def cipd.yaml
â€¦
infra/tricium/function/hello:5b010cd78bc78252dda3e791cd6510c56111a990 was successfully registered
$ cipd set-ref infra/tricium/functions/hello -ref live -version 5b010cd78bc78252dda3e791cd6510c56111a990
[P26551 20:36:06.432 client.go:1004 I] cipd: setting ref of "infra/tricium/function/hello": "live" => "5b010cd78bc78252dda3e791cd6510c56111a990"
Packages:
  infra/tricium/function/hello:5b010cd78bc78252dda3e791cd6510c56111a990
```

You can verify that the package was created and tagged by installing it via
CIPD:

```
$ cd tmp-dir-somewhere
$ cipd init
$ cipd install infra/tricium/function/hello live
```

### Configure your Analyzer

There are two different places where Analyzer definitions can be located:
 - The Tricium service configs
 (either [tricium-prod](https://luci-config.appspot.com/#/services/tricium-prod)
 or [tricium-dev](https://luci-config.appspot.com/#/services/tricium-dev))
 - Your project config (example [tricium-dev.cfg](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/infra/config/tricium-dev.cfg)).

An analyzer definition looks like this:

```
functions {
  type: ANALYZER
  name: "Hello"
  needs: FILES
  provides: RESULTS
  owner: "emso@chromium.org"
  component: "monorail:Infra>Platform>Tricium"
  impls {
    runtime_platform: UBUNTU
    provides_for_platform: UBUNTU
    cmd {
      exec: "hello"
      args: "--output=${ISOLATED_OUTDIR}"
    }
    deadline: 30
    cipd_packages {
      package_name: "infra/tricium/function/hello"
      path: "."
      version: "live"
    }
  }
}
```

In the project config, you'll want to choose what subset of available functions
should be enabled for the project. Here you can add your analyzer and any
isolators that it depends on:

```
selections {
  function: "GitFileIsolator"
  platform: UBUNTU
}

selections {
  function: "Hello"
  platform: UBUNTU
}
```

Testing and release process:

*   In the project config for a test project connected to tricium-dev (e.g.
    [playground/gerrit-tricium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/playground/gerrit-tricium)),
    add the analyzer definition and selection to the project config. Upload an
    example CL to test.
*   If the analyzer is applicable for multiple projects, you can move the
    analyzer definition to the service config (still on tricium-dev) and test.
*   Finally, update the project and/or service config on tricium-prod.

For new versions of an analyzer:

*   Update the project config of a project connected to tricium-dev with a new
    analyzer implementation using the new cipd package of the analyzer.
*   If applicable, move analyzer implementation to the service config on
    tricium-dev.
*   Finally, update the project and/or service config on tricium-prod.

## About [CIPD](https://github.com/luci/luci-go/tree/master/cipd) packages

CIPD package instances have a package name and version. There are 3 types of
versions: hash of instance content, tags (e.g. `version:1.2.3`,
`git_revision:abcdef`), or ref (e.g. live, canary, etc.)

CIPD packages are zip files with a manifest file. They are named by an
instance ID which is a digest of the zip package.

## Analyzer guidelines

### What makes a good analyzer?

 - An analyzer should not be too noisy.
 - An analyzer should be fast enough so that results can generally appear
   before the reviewer reviews the CL.
 - An analyzer should produce clear and actionable comments.

A Tricium analyzer can take more time and include more checks than presubmit.
It should find some results when run on the whole codebase, but not too many so
that it's overwhelming.


### How to Release a New Analyzer Version

If you have an analyzer that's already running and configured, and you want to
release a new version, the following is a general process for release:

First, test locally; try both unit tests and a test-invocation on sample input.
Note, you can run Go unit tests by running `go test ./...`.

Optionally, **try with a local devserver instance of Tricium.** The advantage
of testing it out with a devserver instance is that you can change the configs
without making any actual changes by changing
[tricium/appengine/devcfg](../appengine/devcfg/).

Then, **try it out on project tricium-dev**. You can add your analyzer to the
project config for [the playground
repo](https://chromium.googlesource.com/playground/gerrit-tricium).

After testing with the tricium-dev instance, you can add it to the tricium-prod
instances service config and announce the release on tricium-dev@google.com.
