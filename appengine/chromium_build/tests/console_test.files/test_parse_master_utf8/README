How to recreate the contents of this directory.

1. wget http://build.chromium.org/p/chromium.linux/console
2. mv console in_console.html
3. Find the first revision in in_console.html.  Note its
   Cr-Commit-Position value.
4. Edit app_test.py to change test_parse_master_utf8's rev
   to that value.
5. Edit console_input.html to insert ₩ in various places for
   that revision's entries:
   a. DevRev, prepend ₩ within tag content.
   b. Details, skip, usually not found in output.
   c. DevName, prepend ₩.
   d. DevComment, prepend ₩.
   e. DevStatus, prepend ₩.
6. Outside of that revision's info, edit DevSlave, prepend ₩.
7. Edit app_test.py, uncomment lines in app_test.py that
   write expected contents.
8. Run test.  (This will write expected contents.)
9. Comment lines that write expected comments.
10. Create a CL with the updated content, land it.
