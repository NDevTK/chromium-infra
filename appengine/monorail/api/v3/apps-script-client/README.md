## This directory contains code that make up our v3 Apps Script client library.

client.js is purposely omitted.

To make updates to the library:
1) Update the code here and send in a CL for review.
2) Merge the Cl and copy-paste the changes into Apps Script at go/monorail-v3-apps-script.
3) Create a new static version in Apps Script and update the labeled version 'latest' to point to the new static version.
