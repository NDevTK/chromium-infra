  We will keep track of the number of actions
  of various types by individual users and limit each user's ability
  to perform a large number of those actions.  E.g., no one user can
  create too many new projects.

  Our application code checks three kinds of action limits:
  1. A soft limit on the number of actions in a period of time.
     If this soft limit is exceeded, the user will need to solve a CAPTCHA.
  2. A hard limit on the number of actions in a period of time.
     if this hard limit is exceeded, the requested actions will fail.
  3. A lifetime limit. The user cannot perform this type of action more
     than this many times, ever.  We can adjust the lifetime limit
     for individual users who contact us.

  The numeric values for the actual limits are coded as constants in our
  application.  Only the lifetime limit is stored in this PB, and then only
  if it differs from the default.
