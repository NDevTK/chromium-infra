 * This is a GNU "ld" version script. It is used with the "--version-script"

 *
 * It is typically used to version symbols, but can also be used to set the
 * exportability of symbols. We use it to suppress the export of some of the
 * global symbols from static libraries.
 *
 * We use the "-Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL", which localizes most symbols. However,
 * some seem to be skipped. This script fills in those blanks.
