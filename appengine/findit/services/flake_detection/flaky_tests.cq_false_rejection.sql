# To detect flaky tests causing Chromium CQ false rejections in the past 1 day.
#
# Assumptions for the flake detection in this query are:
# 1. In the same build of the same CL/patchset/builder_id (a bulid id is a tuple
#    of <luci_project_name, buildbucket_name, builder_name>), if a test failed
#    (with patch), it will get retried (without patch) and optionally (retry
#    with patch). This assumption is required because in such cases, even with
#    multiple builds of the same CL/patchset/builder_id, it is still difficult
#    to tell reliably that the failed tests are flaky ones instead of
#    consistently failing ones on ToT due to a bad commit landed into the
#    codebase already. However, this will filter out true flaky tests in these
#    two scenarios, although they are too rare to worry about for now:
#    * A test is so flaky and fails in both (with patch) and (without patch).
#    * A consistently failing test on ToT is made flaky by the patch being
#      tested and it is so flaky that it fails in (with patch).
# 2. In a test step (with patch), a test is a failure if its first run and ALL
#    retries are failures (not PASS and not any expected result).
#    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build/+/917f9c6/scripts/slave/recipe_modules/test_utils/api.py#328
# 3. In a test step (without patch) and (retry with patch), a test is a failure
#    if its first run or any retry is a failure (not PASS and not any expected
#    result). Note that failed tests in (without patch) are ignored, but failed
#    tests in (retry with patch) will fail the build.
#    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build/+/917f9c6/scripts/slave/recipe_modules/test_utils/api.py#349
#    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build/+/917f9c6/scripts/slave/recipe_modules/test_utils/api.py#369
#    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build/+/917f9c6/scripts/slave/recipe_modules/test_utils/util.py#285
# 4. For disabled tests, they should not be run at all and have an empty list or
#    just ['SKIP'] for run.actual of test-results-hrd:events.test_results
#    https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/test-results-hrd:events.test_results
#
#
# A flaky test is said to have caused CQ false rejections if it is a new failure
# (it is a new test or passes ToT on the CI) that caused a flaky build. A flaky
# build is a failed build among the builds for the same CL/patchset/builder_id,
# while there is at least one sucessful build.
# The criteria to detect such flaky tests are:
# 1. If "retry with patch" is enabled, it failed in the (retry with patch) step
#    in a flaky build as defined above. Note that if a test failed in the (retry
#    with patch) step, it implies that the test failed in the matching (with
#    patch) step and passed in the matching (without patch) step, and the
#    equivalence of this is a failed (retry summary) step.
#    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build/+/917f9c6/scripts/slave/recipe_modules/test_utils/api.py#341
# 2. If "retry with patch" is disabled, it failed in the (with patch) step in a
#    flaky build as defined above but passed in the (without patch) step. This
#    is implied by a failed (retry summary) step.
#    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build/+/917f9c6/scripts/slave/recipe_modules/test_utils/api.py#294
#
# Caveat:
# 1. This query does NOT support projects that have no (without patch) in CQ.
# 2. This query only supports Luci builds, because cr-buildbucket.builds.completed_BETA
#    has no steps for buildbot-based builds even they are through buildbucket.
