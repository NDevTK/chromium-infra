"""Simple servlet to store the fact that a user has dismissed a cue card.

Cue cards are small on-page help items that appear when the user has
done a certain action or is viewing a project that is in a certain
state.  The cue card give the user a suggestion of what he/she should
do next.  Cue cards can be dismissed to reduce visual clutter on the
page once the user has learned the content of the suggestion.  That
preference is recorded in the User PB, and the same cue card will not
be presented again to the same user.

Exmple: The logged in user has dismissed the cue card that tells him/her how
to search for numbers in the issue tracker:

  POST /hosting/cues.do
    cue_id=search_for_numbers&token=12344354534
