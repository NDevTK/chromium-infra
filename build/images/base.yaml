infra:
  # Set of infra services used when building images from workstations, on CI
  # waterfall (but not production release builders) and on trybots.
  #
  # Images built using this set of services are OK for local use and for dev
  # clusters, but MUST NOT be deployed to clusters that have access to real
  # user data.
  #
  # Workstations, non-proudction CI builders and trybots are considered NOT
  # pristine enough to use for release builds.
