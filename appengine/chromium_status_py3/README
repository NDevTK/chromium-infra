This is an effort to migrate chromium status to Python3 running on GAE v2. The
old source code (Python 2) is at https://source.corp.google.com/chromium_infra/appengine/chromium_status/.
The bug tracking the effort is https://crbug.com/1121016.

The effort was put on hold due to deprioritisation. So far the following
components have been migrated:

- Updated the runtime environment to py3
- Updated app.yaml to be py3-compatibile
- Created main.py as the entry point
- Enabled Cloud Logging
- Migrated google.appengine.api.db to Cloud NDB
- Migrate users service to OAuth2 + OpenID Connect

There are still items that need to be done:
- Authorization for service accounts (e.g. luci-notify, gerrit)
- Memcache -> Cloud Memory store (if it turns out that memcache is necessary)
- Test and deploy
