# Assumptions

Infra repo is checked out into directory SRC_ROOT (eg., /b/chromium) on Linux or
Mac. Note:
1. For Mac, if shoulGoogleAppEngineLauncher is used to run Findit locally, you
    may have to set the field "Extra Flags" under "Launch Settings" with value
   "$SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/build-failure-analysis.yaml".
2. For Windows, you may have to read script util_scripts/run.sh to learn how
   to run all of the commands manually.

# How to run Findit locally?

From command line, run:
  $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/util_scripts/run.sh run

Then open http://localhost:8080 for the home page.

# How to run test for Findit?

From command line, run:
  $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/util_scripts/run.sh test

If a code path branch is not tested and no line number is shown in the command
line output, you could open code coverage report shown in the output to check.

# How to deploy to appengine?

For testing, deploy to findit-for-waterfall.appspot.com:
  $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/util_scripts/run.sh deploy-test

For release, make sure you are in a clean branch and deploy to findit-for-me.appspot.com:
  cd $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit
  git diff origin/master && git status
  util_scripts/run.sh deploy-prod

To make the new version the default:
1. Go to https://appengine.google.com and select the findit-for-me or findit-for-waterfall app.
2. Click on the 'Versions' link on the left navigation menu.
3. Make the new version in the "default" module as the default version.
   It is optional to update the default version of the "build-failure-analysis" module.
