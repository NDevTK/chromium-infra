INSTALLING TROOPER-O-MATIC
==========================

1. Install nodejs (the npm command must be available)

2. Install bower
   (npm install bower) or (make check)

3. Install dependencies
   (bower install)

UPDATING TROOPER-O-MATIC
========================

In addition to updating your git repository, be sure to update any bower
dependencies (bower update).

TESTING
=======

From the infra/ directory:
./test.py test appengine/trooper_o_matic

Mocha (new-style) tests
-----------------------

The tests can be run in the browser or from the command line.

In the browser: http://localhost:8000/test/run-unit-tests.html

From the command line:

$ make test

This will launch karma, run the tests and watch the source files for
changes. To run once and exit, use:

$ make single-test

Or, you can start karma manually:

$ ../third_party/npm_modules/node_modules/karma/bin/karma start

You can shorten this command to 'karma start' if you run
'npm install [-g] karma-cli'.
