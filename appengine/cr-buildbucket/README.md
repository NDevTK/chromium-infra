# Buildbucket

[go/buildbucket]

Buildbucket is a generic build queue. A build requester can schedule a build
and wait for a result. A building system, such as Buildbot, can lease it, build
it and report a result back.

## Swarmbucket

Buildbucket has native integration with Swarming and Recipes.
A bucket can define builders and a buildbucket build in such bucket is converted
to a swarming task that runs a recipe.
The results are reported back to buildbucket when the task completes.
See [Swarming](doc/swarming.md).

## Buildbot

Buildbucket is integrated with buildbot. You can schedule, cancel, search for
buildbot builds and check their results using buildbucket API.
