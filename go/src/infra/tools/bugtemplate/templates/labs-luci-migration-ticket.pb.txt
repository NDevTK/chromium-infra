// Please delete commented out sections before submission
// Feel free to add free form text.

// Tell us the tracking bug for migrating a builder or builders,
// for which you need new bots. For example, issue 790138.
// Pro tip: mark the currently being filed ticket as blocking
// the issue below.
reference: issue <id>

// Tell us the builder name and its OS if not clear from the name.
builder: <builder name> [<os>]

// Which bot(s) is(are) serving builders on buildbot today?
// Either name (such as build41-m1.golo) or link to a buildbot builder
// page (e.g.
// https://build.chromium.org/deprecated/tryserver.chromium.win/builders/win10_chromium_x64_rel_ng)
slaves: <id(s) | url>

// How many bots do you need?
// For a waterfall (aka CI) builder, this is almost always 1.
// For chromium try builder with 100+ bots, do NOT request copy of
// all 100+ bots at once. Rather, ask for 5..10% at a time
// (see go/migrate2luci for more info).
count:

// Which swarming instance do you want these bots configured for?
// This is almost always https://chromium-swarm.appspot.com,
// if in doubt ask luci-eng@google.com.
