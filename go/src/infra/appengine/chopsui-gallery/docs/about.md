# About ChopsUI

ChopsUI is an effort to create shared web components used across the [Chrome Operations team](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/master/doc/index.md).

* ChopsUI Source Code: [/chromium/infra/crdx/chopsui](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/infra/crdx/chopsui/)
* Component Repo URL: [https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/crdx/chopsui.git](chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/crdx/chopsui.git)

# To use

All ChopsUI components are under a single Bower package that you can install using:

`bower install chopsui`

# Current status

Unstable alpha - We're still actively experimenting with the API and design of
the components listed in this gallery and can't make any promises yet that the
components will be stable.

That said, please feel free to use ChopsUI for your own services! You are also
welcome to add your own components and iterate on them. If changes to these
components end up breaking your service, feel free to contact zhangtiff@chromium.org for support.

# Patches welcome!

Most of what currently exists here in ChopsUI is still pretty experimental.
We're figuring things out as we go along, so please feel free to add your own
components here or submit changes to adjust the existing components to better suit your needs.
