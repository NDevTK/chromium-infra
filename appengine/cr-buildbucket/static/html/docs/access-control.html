    <h2>Access control</h2>
    <p>Each bucket has its own ACLs. By default a bucket is accessible only by
      admins. If a bucket does not exist, its ACL is considered default.</p>

    <p>Buckets and their ACLs are configured by &lt;buildbucket-app-id&gt;.cfg
      files in project repositories. For example, chromium buckets are
      configured in
      <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/infra/project-config/cr-buildbucket.cfg">
       chromium/src</a> repository.

     See <a href="http://luci-config.appspot.com/schemas/projects:buildbucket.cfg">
       BuildbucketCfg protobuf message</a> for file format.
