# Monorail Quick Start

## Mission: track issues to help improve software products.

## Guiding principles
* Flexibility
* Security
* Inclusiveness


## High-Level Organization

A Monorail server is divided into projects, such as /p/chromium and
/p/monorail, that each have a list of project members, and that
contain a set of issues.  Each project also has a page that lists the
history of issue changes, and a set of pages that describe the software
development process configured for that project.

Each issue has metadata such as the issue reporter, owner, CC'd users,
labels, and custom fields.  Each issue also has a list of comments,
which may each have some attachments and amendments to the metadata.

Each user also has a profile page and related pages that show that user's
activity on the site and their hotlists.
