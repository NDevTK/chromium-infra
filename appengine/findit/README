# Assumption

Infra repo is checked out into SRC_ROOT (eg., /b/chromium).
Google Appengine SDK is checked out to $SRC_ROOT/google_appengine automatically.

# How to run Findit locally?

From command line, run:
  cd $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit
  $SRC_ROOT/google_appengine/dev_appserver.py .

Then open http://localhost:8080 for the home page.

# How to run test for Findit?

From command line, run:
  cd $SRC_ROOT/infra
  python test.py test --html-report /tmp/coverage appengine/findit

If a branch is not tested and no line number is shown in the command line
output, you could open file:///tmp/coverage/index.html to check.
