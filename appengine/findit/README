# Assumptions

Infra repo is checked out into directory SRC_ROOT (eg., /b/chromium) on Linux or
Mac. Note:
1. For Mac, if GoogleAppEngineLauncher is used to run Findit locally, you
    may have to set the field "Extra Flags" under "Launch Settings" with value
   "$SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/waterfall-backend.yaml
    $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/waterfall-frontend.yaml".
2. For Windows, you may have to read script util_scripts/run.sh to learn how
   to run all of the commands manually.

# How to set up Polymer?
  sudo apt-get install npm
  npm install -g bower
  cd $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/third_party && bower install && cd -

# How to run Findit locally?

From command line, run:
  $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/util_scripts/run.sh run

Then open http://localhost:8080 for the home page.

# How to run unit tests for Findit?

From command line, run:
  $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/util_scripts/run.sh test

If a code path branch is not tested and no line number is shown in the command
line output, you could check the code coverage report shown in the output.

# How to deploy to appengine?

For testing on dev app, deploy to findit-for-me-dev.appspot.com:
  $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/util_scripts/run.sh deploy-test-dev

For staging test on the product app, deploy to findit-for-me.appspot.com:
  $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/util_scripts/run.sh deploy-test-prod

For release, deploy to findit-for-me.appspot.com:
  $SRC_ROOT/infra/appengine/findit/util_scripts/run.sh deploy-prod
