blocked on the fact that the index with -modified wasn't present.

The new alerts doesn's get a left nav link yet since it's not quite ready for normal use, but you can navigate to it directly.

- Adds a generic /new-alerts/:tree route.
- New api: each tree (using that term loosely here, they're just namespaces) gets its own json feed requested at /api/v1/alerts/:tree
- This only pulls chromium alerts for now.
- The only alert extension currently implemented is builder failures.
- Examine/Snooze/Link Bug are dummy actions for now.
- Need to make some changes to dispatcher so that the revision lists have all the necessary info before we can render them properly.  For now it's just the git hash + link.

This change adds support for the case file.extension:[line <line number>] as found in cases for FindBugs failures for Android builds. Without this change, findit is only able to extract the filename, but not the line number, which can lead to false positives should we add support for filtering by line distance in the future.

the presence of timestamps. Glyco now resets all timestamps to the origin of
