â‚©Make Telemetry tests check the configuration of the OSX Keychain.<br /><br />Historically, the OSX Keychain has been misconfigured on some perf bots, which<br />has caused Telemtry tests to stall. This CL adds checks to emit warnings if the<br />Keychain is misconfigured.<br /><br />I added checks for three common misconfigurations:<br />&nbsp; - Is the default Keychain locked.<br />&nbsp; - Is the default Keychain configured to automatically lock after a period of<br />&nbsp; time.<br />&nbsp; - Are the ACLs of a commonly accessed key in the default keychain<br />&nbsp; misconfigured for the perf bots.<br /><br />The first and third checks are performed by short C programs since the<br />information is easily available through the Security framework, but not from<br />the security CLI.<br /><br />BUG=443340<br /><br />Review URL: https://codereview.chromium.org/809473004<br /><br />Cr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#314921}<br />
