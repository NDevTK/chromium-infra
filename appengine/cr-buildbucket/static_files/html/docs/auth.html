    <h1>Auth</h1>
    <p>Authentication is done via OAuth2 using
      <a href="/auth">Chrome-Infra Auth server</a>. Currently, in order to make
      requests to buildbucket, the requester has to be a member of
      buildbucket-access group. There are service accounts to be used on
      buildbot masters. For development,
      <a href="http://storage.googleapis.com/cr-buildbucket-dev/cr-buildbucket-dev-9c9efb83ec4b.json">
      cr-buildbucket-dev-9c9efb83ec4b.json</a> can be used to authenticate at
      <a href="https://cr-buildbucket-dev.appspot.com">cr-buildbucket-dev</a>.
      For production,
      <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Build%20Infrastructure&summary=buildbucket%20service%20account%20for%20[your%20project]&cc=nodir@chromium.org&comment=Project%20[project%20name]%20needs%20buildbucket%20access.%20Please%20provide%20credentials.
